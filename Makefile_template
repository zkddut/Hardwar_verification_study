# NOTE: The only "derived file build" documentation is in the template files.
#       You may be looking at an old copy of a template file right now.
#       If that is the case, then ignore the following and read the
#       latest template file's documentation. The path to the template
#       files is probably :/verif_shared/toolrc/common/gmake/templates.
#       If your file is based on an old template then you should update.
#       Compare NOW!
#
# NOTE: Only works with "gmake", not "make".
#
# This is a slave/low-level Makefile. It will be called BEFORE any Vera or
# Verilog building takes place if you put this in your RTL directory Makefile:
#    CSRTOOL_FILES := . . .
#
#    $(CSRTOOL_FILES):
#           $(MAKE) -C csrtool -f Makefile SLAVE=1 derivedbuild
# 
# You can do whatever you need in here but there are certain REQUIREMENTS.
#
# 0) You must update any place marked: CUSTOMIZE
#
# 1) The files that get checked into the repository are the the source
#    files and the Makefiles, NOT the derived files.
#
# 2) When derived files are up-to-date compared to the source files,
#    the Makefile MUST NOT DO ANYTHING. That is what make is for and
#    the build process requires this!!!
#
# 3) The Makefile should always be a dependency. You want to build if
#    the makefile has changed! The variable $(MAKEDEPEND) holds the
#    names of the makefiles (names could be changed in the future so always
#    use $(MAKEDEPEND)).
#
# 4) All Makefiles must have the same name (Makefile).
#
# 5) Each call to $(MAKE) for slave Makefiles will pass all "export"
#    variables down to the slave Makefile. This always includes any AAA=5
#    type defines given on the command line in the original call to gmake.
#
